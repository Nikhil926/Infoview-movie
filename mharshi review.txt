<p>In one brilliantly conceived sequence of cultural conversion, <br>
Mahesh Babu playing the NRI tycoon Rishi Kumar,  <br>
follows a wizened farmer into the paddy fields to literally get his feet dirty in the fields.</p>
<p>It takes a whole universe of guts to shoulder one's responsibilities<br> 
as an empowered citizen of India,as Mahesh Babu has done in this film.</P>
<p>If you stay quiet you are accused of pacifism. If you speak up you're an exhibitionist.<br>
 Mahesh Babu who is a formidable icon in Telugu cinema, won't remain quiet any more. <br>
Breaking free of his innate political reservations he speaks out in favour of farmers <br>
of our impoverished country in a voice that never strains to be heard.Advertisement</p>
